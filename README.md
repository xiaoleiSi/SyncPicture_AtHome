# syncPic_AtHome

##Why do this Project?
This project is very useful for my family.

Before, my family include my wife, my parents and me often camera many pictures in our own mobile phone.So We want to upload the pictures to one server in home but we do not trust the server in the remote cloud. So, I built a server in my Raspberry using python, and the APP this one. 

Using this APP, we can select the pictures and upload them to this home server in LAN. It is convient and safe.

##How to use it?
The first step, you need run the server script in your PC or Raspberry(I prefer Raspberry because power saving).

The second step,this APP allow you to select the pictures(in fact, other format files allowed) and upload them to your server.

If everything run well, the files will stored in your server.
